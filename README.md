# Privacy-Checklist
I am not a cyber-security professional, just someone who has had all the data gather and sold by big-tech weaponized against them, and who has realized there's no guide for extricating one's self from telemetry hell.

# Understanding/Domain Knowledge
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) - A tactic in which an adversary attempts place themselves in a position to directly alter your web-traffic.

Stingray - A form of MitM in which an attacker pretends to be a person or node on your network. Examples might include a fake cell tower, a lawfully wire-tapped router or ISP server, a compromised software uploader, or any other type of "gatekeeper" that stands between you and the internet.

Triangulation - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to learn your exact IP address or location, so that they can target you.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to exploit poor sanitation of user content in a web application in order to execute arbitrary code.

Supply-Chain Attack - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to alter the software or data at the point-of-upload. Any downloads of the software will be tainted, with no recourse.



# Goal:
Be completely anonymous online.

# Encrypted Messaging
Use encrypted messengers whenever, wherever, and however you can.
Examples include: Signal, Element, etc.
Ensure that if you're using android, to properly lock down the common attack vectors as per our Security-Checklist prior to engaging in any of this, or you could lose your account.
