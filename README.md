# Privacy-Checklist
A freely available toolkit for thwarting and subverting the data-whoring practices of big-tech.
These guides are intended for people attempting to escape "Hacker Hell", a situation in which all of their tech is 100% compromised.

## IF YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES: CONTACT A PROFESSIONAL INSTEAD
## IF YOU HAVE TRANSPORTATION: SEEK AUTHORITIES INSTEAD
## Always remember to do your due-diligence, especially if you are unable to verify the integrity of your internet connection.

One should lock down their devices as-per the "https://github.com/TernaryFortress/Security-Checklist" repository prior to taking these steps.

I am not a security researcher, this is a blueprint assembled exclusively for, and detailing what is required to escape the aforementioned situation and establish contact with the outside world, in order to escape oppression and cyber-abuse. Other guides will provide more extensive and complete guidance, along with all the information-overload that such guidance entails.

# Understanding/Domain Knowledge
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) - A tactic in which an adversary attempts place themselves in a position to directly alter your web-traffic.
Triangulation - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to learn your IP address so that they can MitM your connection. Telemetry is a common exfiltration vector of this information.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to exploit poor sanitation of user content in a web application in order to execute arbitrary code.
Supply-Chain Attack - A tactic in which an adversary attempts to alter the source of data at the point-of-upload. Any downloads of the software will be tainted.

# Goal:
Be completely anonymous online.

# Encrypted Messaging
Use encrypted messengers whenever, wherever, and however you can.
Examples include: Signal, Element, FB Messenger (donates your data), etc.
Ensure that if you're using android, to properly lock down the common attack vectors as per our Security-Checklist prior to engaging in any of this, or you could lose your account.
Facebook has been known to cooperate with authorities - You may view this as a positive or a negative, depending on who's in charge at the time.

## Facebook 
Facebook sells your data. Here's how to lock down telemetry in the Facebook app:
1: > "Settings & Privacy" or Gear Icon
2: > "Privacy checkup"
3: > 

## Messenger
In Facebook Messenger:
1: > "Settings & Privacy" or Gear Icon
2: > "Active Status" = Disabled
3: > "App lock" = Enabled
