# Operating Systems

## Windows

Windows has something called Group Policy Manager, which you can use to disable telemetry and other system-enabled tools like Recall.

We will provide a guide shortly, but in the mean-time, now you know where to look.

## Mac/Apple

I have not had the opportunity to lock down a Mac or Apple computer, but they are generally more privacy-respecting than Microsoft.

## Linux

Linux has a variety of packages, all of which do different things better or worse than each other.

It is advised to avoid what are known as "Community Distro's", because of the risk of either Stingrays or Supply-Chain-Compromise. Focus on "Enterprise" distributions.

Ubuntu: This OS tries to match Windows fairly closely, and focuses on having a usable desktop environment. Their Pro version is also free for the first handful of computers.

When loading Ubuntu for the first time, you will be asked if it's okay to transmit system data. Select "No", and desktop telemetry is disabled.

Red Hat: This OS tries to be a developer workstation and comes with some niche features, however it's purchase-only.

As usual, do your own research when deciding on something important like operating system
